# Super JSON workflow Builder (we need a nice product name)
The main aim of this JSON wizard is to create another JSON that can be used to produce abitray workflows.

# Advantages of using a JSON based workflow
Using a JSON as the foundation starts offers a whole new way of creating workflows in a super flexible way.
We are in teh Blockchain space and needed something like that to support varieties of license tokens but we thought that this approach can also serve anyone that is in need os a versatile and flexible workflow solution.

# Why did we build it
We want to support numerous workflows for creating JSON files that will be used as metadata for a specific Ethereum token called ERC-1155. 
This token is a new standard token that was issued mainly from and by the gaming industry to support the numerous assets a game obtains.
Many props for developing the standard to these guys --> Link to EIP of 1155 listing the authors
