## What is MegaFlow? ðŸš€

MegaFlow is a React component to build workflows based on JSON schemas, powered by React Hook Forms.

As there are multiple workflows to generate in the company, which all of them are custom, also can be mofied, we decided to have a component which will be used across all of our projects, so that it is possible to keep consistency along them.

## Main libraries/technologies used in MegaFlow: ðŸ¦¾

Below you can find main libraries/technologies which we have used in Rockskit.
All other libraries are used by basing on design needs. Moreover, there is an example (story) which shows how this component works, based on provided schema in Storybook.

- Storybook ðŸ‘‰ Shortly, it is a development playground. We use it as an environment for components development. Also we build and deploy it to Github Pages as a showcase for the components we have.
- Styled-Components ðŸ‘‰ CSS-in-JS library which we use to make style neatly arranged through every component
- Material-UI ðŸ‘‰ Most of the components are built on top of MUI, it lets us save significant amount of time, since we do not need to write everything from scratch
- React-Hook-Form ðŸ‘‰ Form elements are implemented in a way to be compatible with RHF, as it's one of the best form libraries for React.

## How to use RocksKit? ðŸŽ®

React component to build workflows based on JSON schemas powered by React Hook Forms.

</div>

JSON.parse()

```js
const json = '{"result":true, "count":42}';
const obj = JSON.parse(json);

console.log(obj.count);
// expected output: 42

console.log(obj.result);
// expected output: true
```

FormProvider Performance

React Hook Form's FormProvider is built upon React's Context API. It solves the problem where data is passed through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level. This also causes the component tree to trigger a re-render when React Hook Form triggers a state update, but we can still can optimise our App if required via the example below.
CodeSandbox

reset

For controlled components like React-Select which do not expose a ref prop, you will have to reset the input value manually with setValue or connect your component via useController or Controller.

You will need to pass defaultValues to useForm in order to reset the Controller components' value.

When you are subscribed to formState, it's important to decouple reset with handleSubmit. Both will update formState and handleSubmit is async by default. You can check out a working example below:

When invoking reset({ value }) without supplying defaultValues via useForm, the library will replace defaultValues with a shallow clone value object which you provide (not deepClone).
